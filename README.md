# Intro to Technical Interview Prep | TIP101

Welcome to the **Intro to Technical Interview Prep | TIP101** repository! This repository documents my progress in the course, which I am taking this summer to improve my technical interview skills.

## Overview

This course, provided by CodePath, focuses on preparing for technical interviews by solving a variety of coding problems. The main programming language used is Python, and the topics covered include:

- Arrays
- Hash Tables
- Two-Pointer Techniques
- Trees
- Recursion
- Linked Lists

## UMPIRE Method

UMPIRE is a structured approach to solving coding problems during technical interviews. It stands for:

- **U**nderstand the problem
- **M**ap out a plan
- **P**suedocode
- **I**mplement the code
- **R**eview the code
- **E**valuate the solution

I use this method to ensure a thorough understanding and a methodical approach to problem-solving.

## Weekly Practice

Each week, I work on a new set of interview-style questions, focusing on one or more of the topics listed above. I practice these problems regularly and follow the UMPIRE method for each problem to build a solid foundation in problem-solving techniques.


Happy coding and good luck with your interview preparation!
